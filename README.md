# The Bolide Picture Processing Unit

This is — or will be — a video card for microcontrollers to display graphics on a screen via HDMI, with similar graphical features as old computers and game consoles. Lots of cheap microcontrollers have enough processing power to do software rendering with no problem, but this is just a fun project to help me learn FPGAs with. 

This repo is based off of this here [Tang Nano 9K Minimal HDMI Example](https://github.com/jiink/Tang-Nano-9K-Minimal-HDMI-Example).

This project uses [Gowin EDA](https://www.gowinsemi.com/en/support/download_eda/). It's kind of like Visual Studio but for FPGAs.

Here's a good video on using Gowin: ["Get Started With FPGAs and Verilog in 13 Minutes!" by Doctor Volt on YouTube, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWm9pJ2KobA)

Here's a good resource on a basic HDMI video signal works: https://www.fpga4fun.com/HDMI.html
